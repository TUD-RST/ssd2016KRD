This repository contains supporting calculations for the paper: 
# "Holonomic Modeling and Hierarchic Tracking Control of an Unstable Underactuated Nonholonomic System"

which is submitted to the [SSD2016 Conference](http://www.ssd-conf.org/ssd16/index.php?site=cfp&conf=SAC).

The source code mainly consists in an IPython notebook, where documentation, actual source code and its output (including figures) can be combined in one executable document to facilitate comprehensibility.
